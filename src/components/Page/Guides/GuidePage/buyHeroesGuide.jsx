          <h1>How to Buy Heroes in Mobile Legends Without Using Diamond</h1>
          <p>
            Mobile legends currently have 93 heroes in-game but new players only
            Have two heroes to play at the beginning. It is so challenging for
            new players because free heroes are weak(not in the meta). This
            guide explain how to get heroes in mobile legends without using
            diamond. Before purchasing a hero, it is better to have a look
            online or practice/try hero in classic or vs AI mode using a trial
            card.

          <p>1. Using Battle Points to purchase heroes</p>
          <p>
            All heroes can be purchased using battle points except Odette, and
            most of them cost 32000 BP, especially for new heroes. Battle points
            are a bit hard to get if you don't play the game often. There are
            some tricks to get BP fast, so you don't need to try hard to get the
            heroes you want. Firstly, use a double bp ticket, which gives you
            double bp than you usually get after the game has finished, and the
            maximum gold you can get per day become 9000BP from 7500BP.
            Secondly, collect a daily reward as you complete quests in mobile
            legends gives some extra battle points.

          <p>2. Draw Lucky Spin</p>
          <p>
            If you are wondering what is the usage of ticket in mobile legends,
            you can use the ticket to buy some heroes which can be purchased by
            ticket in shop such as Gord, Akai and many more and draw the lucky
            spin. Lucky spin can give you free heroes/skin, which is displayed
            as the prize. As the name says, it depends on your luck about how
            many tickets you will spend to get heroes/skin. Each draw cost you
            Twenty tickets and there is no limit on how much you can spend the
            tickets. If you get a hero that you already own in the lucky spin,
            you will get 10800 BP.

          <p>3. Using Hero Fragment to purchase heroes</p>
          <p>
            On top of battle points, diamonds and tickets you can also get
            Hero/skin fragment from weekly activity reward, gold chest, and
            event quests. Hero fragment can be used to buy some heroes who are
            available in fragment shop and currently there are 12 heroes which
            cost 120 hero fragments for each hero.
