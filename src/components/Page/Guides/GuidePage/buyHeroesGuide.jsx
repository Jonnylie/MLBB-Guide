          <h1>How to Buy Heroes in Mobile Legends Without Using Diamond</h1>
          <p>
            Mobile legends currently have 93 heroes in game but new players only
            have two hero to play at the beggining. It is so frustated for new
            player because free heroes are weak(not in the meta). This guide
            explain how to get heroes in mobile legends without using diamond.
            Before purchasing a hero, it is better to have a look online or

          <p>1. Using Battle Points to purchase heroes</p>
          <p>
            All heroes can be purchased using battle points except Odette and
            most of them cost 32000 BP especially for new heroes. Battle points
            is a bit hard to get if you don't play the game often. There are
            some tricks to get BP fast so you don't need to try hard to get
            heroes you want. Firstly, use double bp ticket which gives you
            double bp than normally you get after game has finished and maximum
            gold you can get per day become 9000BP from 7500BP. Secondly,
            collect daily reward as you finish quest in mobile legends it give
            some battle points.

          <p>2. Draw Lucky Spin</p>
          <p>
            If you are wondering what is the used of ticket in mobile legends,
            you can use ticket to buy some heroes which can be purchased by
            ticket in shop such as Gord, Akai and many more and draw the lucky
            spin. Lucky spin can give you free heroes/skin which is displayed as
            the prize. As what the name says, it depends on your luck about how
            many tickets you will spend to get heroes/skin. Each draw cost you
            20 tickets and there is no limit how much you can spend ticket. If
            you get hero that you already own in the lucky spin, you will get
            10800 BP.
